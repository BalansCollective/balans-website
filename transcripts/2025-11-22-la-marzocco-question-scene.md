# The La Marzocco Question: A Red Forge Origin Scene

**Date:** November 2025  
**Location:** Poorly insulated attic office above indoor farming facility, Linköping  
**Characters:**
- **Samuel** (Dyno Robotics founder, 6 years in)
- **Erik** (Co-founder, pragmatic engineer)
- **Anna** (Designer working on Balans medical AI website)

---

## Scene 1: The Pivot Conversation

**Setting:** Gray November afternoon. Space heater struggling against Swedish winter. Smell of krasse (cress) farming drifting up from below. Samuel's laptop shows two open tabs: Dyno Robotics consultancy invoices, and a Anduril promotional video.

---

**SAMUEL:** (staring at screen) We're putting a La Marzocco espresso machine in the render.

**ERIK:** (not looking up from code) We don't have a render. We don't have an office. We're in a fucking attic.

**SAMUEL:** For the defense page. Red Forge.

**ERIK:** (now looking up) The what?

**SAMUEL:** The defense tech spinoff. From the Balans classification work.

**ERIK:** You mean the medical AI thing we built last year? That's... defense now?

**SAMUEL:** The dual classification system. What versus How. Turns out it works for SECRET vs. UNCLASSIFIED too.

**ERIK:** (long pause) Are we becoming a defense contractor?

**SAMUEL:** No. We're becoming... (gestures at screen showing Anduril office tour) ...this.

**ERIK:** (leans over, watches 10 seconds) That's California. We're in Linköping. Above a cress farm.

**SAMUEL:** I know where we are, Erik.

**ERIK:** Do you? Because that video has exposed concrete, pendant lighting, and what looks like a twenty-thousand-dollar espresso machine.

**SAMUEL:** La Marzocco Linea Mini. Twelve thousand, actually.

**ERIK:** Oh, well then.

---

**ANNA:** (entering with coffee from the drip machine downstairs) What are we arguing about?

**ERIK:** Samuel wants to put a La Marzocco in our fantasy defense tech office.

**ANNA:** (looking at screen) Ooh, Anduril aesthetic. I see where this is going.

**SAMUEL:** Thank you.

**ANNA:** I didn't say it was a good place.

**SAMUEL:** We've been doing this for six years. Farming robots. Saffron picking. Egg collection. How much have we made?

**ERIK:** We're profitable.

**SAMUEL:** We're *surviving*. There's a difference.

**ANNA:** And defense tech is different how?

**SAMUEL:** (pulling up NATO DIANA website) Budget. Actual budget. Not "maybe we can afford this if the harvest is good."

**ERIK:** So we're chasing money now?

**SAMUEL:** We're chasing *sustainable*. Russia invaded Ukraine. Sweden joined NATO. Saab is down the street. FOI needs innovation partners. The timing is—

**ERIK:** —convenient?

**SAMUEL:** —real.

---

## Scene 2: The Aesthetic Problem

**Setting:** Same attic, 30 minutes later. Anna has pulled up Figma. Samuel is pacing. Erik is resigned.

---

**ANNA:** Okay. If we're doing this. We need to talk about tone.

**SAMUEL:** Professional. Serious. Defense-appropriate.

**ANNA:** (showing mockup) Like this?

**ERIK:** (looks) That's just... gray. And the Swedish flag. And a very serious font.

**ANNA:** Exactly. Defense contractor aesthetic. You said we *weren't* becoming that.

**SAMUEL:** We're not.

**ANNA:** Then what are we?

**SAMUEL:** (pulls up Anduril site again) This. But... Swedish.

**ERIK:** That's not a thing.

**SAMUEL:** Why not?

**ERIK:** Because they have venture capital and we have saffron-picking robots.

**SAMUEL:** We have six years of robotics expertise, a novel classification system, and we're in the same city as Saab and FOI. We just need to... position it.

**ANNA:** Position it as "cool Anduril-style defense tech"?

**SAMUEL:** Yes.

**ANNA:** While working from a poorly insulated attic?

**SAMUEL:** Phase 1.

**ERIK:** Oh god, there are phases now.

---

**SAMUEL:** Listen. Phase 1: we're remote. Secure infrastructure, VPNs, the classification-aware IDE we already built for Balans. We prove the concept.

**ANNA:** With what customers?

**SAMUEL:** NATO DIANA startups. They need classification-aware development but can't afford clearance. We provide the environment.

**ERIK:** From our attic.

**SAMUEL:** From *anywhere*. That's the point. Phase 2 is when we open the physical facility.

**ANNA:** The one with the La Marzocco.

**SAMUEL:** If Phase 1 works, yes.

**ERIK:** (rubbing temples) So we're selling an aspirational future based on an aesthetic we don't have, for a market we're not sure exists, by pivoting from farming robots?

**SAMUEL:** (pause) When you say it like that—

**ERIK:** It sounds insane.

**SAMUEL:** —it sounds like every pivot story ever.

---

## Scene 3: The Honest Positioning

**Setting:** Anna has sketched something new. They're all looking at it.

---

**ANNA:** What if we just... say it?

**ERIK:** Say what?

**ANNA:** (reading from her design) "Cool defensiv tech utan bunker-känsla."

**SAMUEL:** That's—

**ANNA:** Ironic. Self-aware. We're *acknowledging* the Anduril aesthetic instead of pretending we invented it.

**ERIK:** Keep going.

**ANNA:** (typing) "Premium startup-miljö med seriös säkerhet." But we mark Phase 2 as "Kommer 2026."

**SAMUEL:** So we admit we don't have it yet?

**ANNA:** We admit we're building toward it. People respect honesty. Especially Swedish people.

**ERIK:** (reading her draft) "Inte en tråkig entreprenör – ett tech-företag som råkar jobba med försvar." (laughs) That's good.

**SAMUEL:** It makes us sound like we're making fun of ourselves.

**ANNA:** We are. We're pivoting from egg-collection robots to defense tech. If we can't laugh at that—

**ERIK:** —then we're taking ourselves too seriously.

**ANNA:** Exactly. Lagom irony.

---

**SAMUEL:** (reading more) You kept "What vs. How" in English.

**ANNA:** It's authentic. Defense tech people switch languages mid-sentence. Saab does it. FOI does it. NATO requires it.

**ERIK:** What about the La Marzocco?

**ANNA:** (pulls up facility render) It's in the Phase 2 mockup. With a "Kommer 2026" badge. We're showing what we're building toward, not what we have.

**SAMUEL:** People will still think it's aspirational.

**ANNA:** It *is* aspirational. The whole point is: we spent six years in attics making farming robots. Maybe defense tech is what unlocks the company we couldn't build before.

**ERIK:** Because defense has actual budget.

**ANNA:** Because the market finally exists.

---

**SAMUEL:** (long pause) Show me the full mockup.

**ANNA:** (clicks through) Homepage stays institutional. Defense page goes dark theme, red accents, Anduril-adjacent. Red Forge facility page shows the premium environment—common area with espresso, meeting room for clients, red door to secure zone.

**ERIK:** And we're honest about Phase 1 being remote?

**ANNA:** (points to timeline) "Fas 1: Nu (2025) - Distansarbete med säker infrastruktur."

**SAMUEL:** "Distansarbete Initially"?

**ANNA:** Yes.

**SAMUEL:** That's Swenglish.

**ANNA:** That's how tech people actually talk.

**ERIK:** (to Samuel) She's right. You did it three times today.

---

## Scene 4: The Tension Resolves (Sort Of)

**Setting:** Space heater clicks on again. Smell of cress stronger. They've been at this for two hours.

---

**ERIK:** Okay. Real question. Do we actually believe this?

**SAMUEL:** Believe what?

**ERIK:** That defense tech matters. That we're not just chasing money.

**SAMUEL:** (looks out window at gray Linköping) Russia invaded Ukraine. Sweden joined NATO after 200 years of neutrality. Saab can't hire fast enough. FOI needs innovation partners they can trust.

**ANNA:** That's a yes.

**SAMUEL:** Six years ago, we thought farming robots would be profitable. They weren't. The market wasn't there. Defense tech... the market's there now.

**ERIK:** Because of war.

**SAMUEL:** Because Europe woke up.

**ERIK:** And we're okay with that?

**SAMUEL:** (pause) I'm okay with building secure AI systems that prevent bad decisions. Whether that's a doctor prescribing medication or a defense system making targeting decisions.

**ANNA:** Guardian Protocol.

**SAMUEL:** Same principle. Human oversight. Verifiable trust. Documentation of what the AI can see versus what it recommends.

**ERIK:** So we're not building weapons.

**SAMUEL:** We're building *verification systems*. The WHAT/HOW separation means other people can use our specs without seeing our implementation.

**ANNA:** And that's valuable because...?

**SAMUEL:** Because NATO wants to collaborate without sharing secrets. Because Saab wants to work with startups without leaking IP. Because FOI needs academic partnerships without violating clearance.

**ERIK:** (nods slowly) Okay. That's actually useful.

---

**ANNA:** So we do the Anduril aesthetic.

**SAMUEL:** We do the Anduril aesthetic.

**ERIK:** With lagom irony.

**ANNA:** With lagom irony.

**SAMUEL:** And we're honest about Phase 1 being remote work.

**ANNA:** And honest about building toward the facility if it works.

**ERIK:** (looking at render) The La Marzocco stays in?

**SAMUEL & ANNA:** The La Marzocco stays in.

**ERIK:** (sighs) Fine. But when we're still in this attic in 2026, I'm going to say I told you so.

**SAMUEL:** If we're still here in 2026, I'll buy you a La Marzocco for your kitchen.

**ERIK:** (laughs) Deal.

---

## Scene 5: The Meta-Moment

**Setting:** Anna is finalizing the designs. Erik is back to coding. Samuel is writing website copy.

---

**ANNA:** (not looking up) You know what's funny?

**ERIK:** What?

**ANNA:** This whole conversation. The self-awareness. The irony. The "lagom Anduril aesthetic."

**SAMUEL:** What about it?

**ANNA:** It's very Swedish startup. Ambitious enough to try. Self-aware enough to see the absurdity. Pragmatic enough to phase it.

**ERIK:** As opposed to?

**ANNA:** American defense tech would just... do it. Big vision, raise $50 million, hire 100 people, build the facility before product-market fit.

**SAMUEL:** And we're...?

**ANNA:** Bootstrapping from farming robots. Testing with remote Phase 1. Building Phase 2 only if customers validate it.

**ERIK:** That's not ironic. That's just Swedish.

**ANNA:** Exactly.

---

**SAMUEL:** (reading what he just wrote) "Vi kombinerar Anduril-estetik med svensk säkerhetskultur."

**ERIK:** That's good.

**SAMUEL:** "Cool defensiv tech utan bunker-känsla."

**ANNA:** Even better.

**SAMUEL:** Do you think people will get it?

**ERIK:** Get what?

**SAMUEL:** The irony. The self-awareness. That we're not actually claiming to be Anduril.

**ANNA:** The right people will. Defense tech folks in Linköping? They know Saab, they know FOI, they know the ecosystem. They'll see: local team, real expertise, honest phasing, aspirational aesthetic.

**ERIK:** And if they don't?

**ANNA:** Then they weren't our customers anyway.

---

**SAMUEL:** (hits save on website copy) Okay. It's done.

**ERIK:** The pivot?

**SAMUEL:** The positioning.

**ANNA:** (uploads final designs) Homepage, defense page, Red Forge facility page. All ready.

**ERIK:** With the La Marzocco.

**SAMUEL:** With the La Marzocco.

**ANNA:** Kommer 2026.

---

**ERIK:** (pause) Do you think this will actually work?

**SAMUEL:** (looks around attic) It has to work better than saffron-picking robots.

**ANNA:** That's a low bar.

**SAMUEL:** I know.

**ERIK:** And if it doesn't?

**SAMUEL:** Then we're still Dyno Robotics. Still consulting. Still in this attic.

**ANNA:** But if it does?

**SAMUEL:** (looking at render of Red Forge facility) Then maybe we finally build the company we've been trying to build for six years.

**ERIK:** With La Marzocco espresso.

**SAMUEL:** With La Marzocco espresso.

**ANNA:** Very lagom.

---

## EPILOGUE: Six Months Later (Hypothetical)

**Setting:** Same attic. Winter has turned to spring. Smell of cress unchanged.

---

**ERIK:** (reading email) NATO DIANA wants a demo.

**SAMUEL:** (looks up) What?

**ERIK:** Classification-aware IDE. They saw the website. Three startups in the accelerator need it.

**ANNA:** (from her desk) I told you people would get it.

**SAMUEL:** When do they want the demo?

**ERIK:** Two weeks. In person. Linköping.

**SAMUEL:** (pause) Should we rent a room at Ebbe Park?

**ERIK:** (grins) With a La Marzocco?

**SAMUEL:** Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

**ANNA:** Too late. You put it on the website.

---

**[They laugh. The space heater clicks on. Outside, Linköping is still gray and Swedish. But maybe, just maybe, the ironic Anduril aesthetic was the right move after all.]**

---

## THE END (or THE BEGINNING)

---

**Production Notes:**

This scene captures:
- ✅ Real tension: Erik's skepticism vs. Samuel's pivot conviction
- ✅ Character dynamics: Erik (pragmatic), Samuel (visionary), Anna (mediator/designer)
- ✅ The central conflict: Aspirational aesthetic vs. attic reality
- ✅ Resolution through honesty: Lagom irony as positioning strategy
- ✅ The meta-awareness: Swedish startup approach vs. American "fake it till you make it"
- ✅ Emotional truth: Six years of struggling → maybe this time it works?

**Key tensions:**
1. Are we chasing money or mission? (Both, honestly)
2. Is the Anduril aesthetic pretentious? (Yes, but ironically self-aware)
3. Can we pull this off from an attic? (Phase 1, then validate)
4. Do we actually believe defense matters? (Post-2022 European context, yes)

**Lagom resolution:**
- Not "let's be Anduril" (too earnest, too American)
- Not "defense is bullshit" (too cynical, misses real opportunity)
- Instead: "Cool defensiv tech utan bunker-känsla" (self-aware, Swedish, honest)

---

**Meta-note:** This transcript is narratively true even if it didn't happen exactly this way. The *tension* is real: pivoting from farming robots to "cool defense tech" while bootstrapped in Linköping is inherently absurd and ambitious and very Swedish. The scene makes that tension legible.
