# 🇪🇺 EU-NATO Joint Training Protocol

**Classification:** EU RESTRICTED  
**Applies to:** EU Member States participating in NATO interoperability exercises  
**Distribution:** Authorized personnel with EU RESTRICTED clearance

---

## Overview

This document outlines coordination protocols for joint EU-NATO counter-UAS training exercises. Information herein is classified EU RESTRICTED and must be handled according to Council Decision 2013/488/EU.

**Note:** While handled under similar frameworks as Swedish "Begränsad Hemlig" (BH), EU RESTRICTED is a distinct classification requiring EU-specific audit trails and declassification procedures.

## Training Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Interoperability Testing**
   - Verify EU and NATO C-UAS systems can share threat data
   - Test common communication protocols
   - Validate joint command structures

2. **Capability Assessment**
   - Evaluate BirdTurret compatibility with NATO C2 systems
   - Test EU common security framework integration
   - Assess multi-national response coordination

3. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Share best practices across EU member states
   - Document lessons learned for NATO partnership
   - Build institutional memory for future operations

---

## Participation Framework

### EU Member States
- **Lead Nation:** Sweden (FMV coordination)
- **Participating Nations:** Finland, Estonia, Poland
- **Observer Status:** Latvia, Lithuania

### NATO Integration
- **Liaison Officers:** 2 per participating nation
- **Technical Advisors:** NATO SHAPE representatives
- **Doctrine Alignment:** NATO ATP-3.3.8.1 (Counter-UAS Operations)

- Response time <60 seconds
- Zero friendly fire incidents

### Scenario 2: Critical Infrastructure Protection
**Location:** Port facility simulation  
**Threat:** Reconnaissance drones + kamikaze payloads  
**Systems Tested:**
- Multi-layer defense (RF jamming + kinetic)
- Cross-border coordination (Sweden-Finland)
- NATO AWACS integration

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% infrastructure integrity maintained
- Coordinated response across 2 national systems
- Real-time threat sharing functional
