# BirdTurret Cost Analysis

## Classification: BEGRÄNSAT HEMLIG (Restricted Secret)

## System Costs by Version

| Version | Hardware Cost | Cost/Engagement | Capacity | Training Time |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| **V1** | €2,350 | €0.01 | Unlimited (RF) | 2 hours |
| **V2** | €10,800 | €0.059 | 12 kinetic + unlimited RF | 2 days |
| **V3.5** | €15,000 | €0.50 | 800 shots + unlimited RF | 4 hours |
| **V4** | €25,000 | €0.50 | 800 shots + unlimited RF | 1 week |

## Comparison to Alternatives

### Traditional Missile Systems

**Stinger Missile**:
- Cost per shot: €50,000
- Effective range: 4.8 km
- Training time: 6 weeks
- **BirdTurret advantage**: 100,000× cheaper per engagement

**Crotale NG**:
- System cost: €60M
- Cost per missile: €400,000
- Effective range: 11 km
- **BirdTurret advantage**: 800,000× cheaper per engagement

### RF Jamming Only Systems

**SkyWall 300**:
- System cost: €50,000
- Cost per net: €500
- Effective range: 100m
- Capacity: 8 shots
- **BirdTurret advantage**: 3.3× cheaper system, 100× more capacity

## Ukraine Context Economics

**Ukraine Drone Threat Scale** (Nov 2025):
- 500-600 drones/day
- ~30% engagement rate (150-180 engagements/day)

### Cost Comparison (30-day period)

**Traditional Missiles** (4,500 engagements):
- Cost: 4,500 × €50,000 = **€225,000,000** (€225M)

**BirdTurret V3.5** (4,500 engagements):
- Primary (RF): 3,900 × €0.01 = €39
- Secondary (shotgun): 600 × €0.50 = €300
- **Total: €339**

**Savings**: €224,999,661 per month per FOB

**BirdTurret systems needed** (assuming 100m perimeter coverage):
- 30 FOBs × 1 system = 30 systems
- System cost: 30 × €15,000 = €450,000
- **Payback period: 2 days** (vs missile costs)

## Operational Cost Analysis

### Personnel Costs (Eliminated in V4)

**Traditional Air Defense**:
- 24/7 coverage: 4 operators × 3 shifts = 12 personnel
- Annual salary: 12 × €40,000 = €480,000/year

**BirdTurret V4 (Autonomous)**:
- 24/7 coverage: 1 supervisor
- Annual salary: €40,000/year
- **Savings**: €440,000/year per system

### Maintenance Costs

**BirdTurret**:
- Annual: €2,000 (software updates, calibration)
- Component replacement: €500/year average

**Traditional Systems**:
- Annual: €50,000+ (missile storage, guidance updates)

## ROI Calculation

**BirdTurret V4 Investment**:
- Initial: €25,000 (system)
- Annual: €42,000 (1 operator + maintenance)
- **Total Year 1**: €67,000

**Traditional System**:
- Initial: €60M (Crotale NG)
- Annual: €480,000 (12 operators) + €50,000 (maintenance) = €530,000
- **Total Year 1**: €60,530,000

**Break-even**: Immediate (system cost difference pays for itself with first engagement)

## Scalability

**1,000 FOB Deployment** (Ukraine scale):

**BirdTurret V4**:
- Systems: 1,000 × €25,000 = €25M
- Operators: 1,000 × €40,000 = €40M/year
- **Total 5-year**: €225M

**Traditional Missiles**:
- Systems: 1,000 × €60M = €60,000M (€60B)
- Operators: 1,000 × €480K = €480M/year
- **Total 5-year**: €62,400M (€62.4B)

**Savings**: €62,175M (€62.2B) over 5 years

## Conclusion

BirdTurret represents a **structural cost advantage** in drone defense:
- 100,000× cheaper per engagement (shotgun vs missile)
- Unlimited RF jamming capacity (no per-shot cost)
- Autonomous operation reduces personnel 12:1
- Payback period: Days (not years)

**Strategic Implication**: At Ukraine threat scale, cost-effective defense becomes economically viable. Traditional missile-based systems are unsustainable at 500-600 drones/day.
