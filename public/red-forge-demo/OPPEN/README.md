# BirdTurret Project - Public Overview

## Classification: ÖPPEN (Unclassified)

**Project Goal:** Cost-effective autonomous drone defense system for military installations.

## System Overview

BirdTurret is a multi-tower drone defense system designed to protect against small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) threats. The system combines:

- **RF Jamming** (primary defense)
- **Kinetic Intercept** (backup defense)
- **AI-Assisted Targeting** (operator support)
- **Guardian Protocol** (ethical AI safety)

## Key Features

- **360° Coverage**: Multiple towers provide complete perimeter defense
- **Cost-Effective**: €0.50 per engagement (vs €50,000 for missiles)
- **Operator-Friendly**: FPS-style interface, 2-hour training time
- **Scalable**: 1-8 towers depending on perimeter size

## Project Versions

- **V1**: Single tower proof-of-concept (micro-assist targeting)
- **V2**: Multi-tower coordinated defense (sector management)
- **V3**: Autonomous operation (AI integration)
- **V3.5**: Shotgun integration (kinetic backup)
- **V4**: Guardian Protocol (ethical AI)
