    "title": "⚠️ Understanding the AI Risk",
    "p1": "Most AI tools are designed to maximize engagement—to give you more ideas, deeper connections, faster insights. For most users, most of the time, this is helpful.",
    "p2": "But for certain conditions, engagement becomes amplification.",
    "p3": "During hypomanic episodes, the brain's salience network (what determines 'importance') is hyperactive. Every thought feels critically urgent. Normal AI interaction can trigger explanation cascades—where one idea generates five more, which generate twenty-five more, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that makes regulation nearly impossible.",
    "both_sides": "This narrative shows BOTH sides of AI:",
    "amplification": "June 22-24 (Amplification): Morgan uses AI tools 'normally'—asking for insights, exploring connections, generating frameworks. The AI is helpful, engaging, productive. But it feeds the hypomanic pattern, making it harder to stop, harder to sleep, harder to be present for family.",
    "anchoring": "June 27-28 (Anchoring): Morgan builds a different kind of AI tool—one designed to resist amplification during elevated states. L1-first explanations (no conceptual rabbit holes). Forced prioritization ('Which ONE idea matters?'). Reality anchoring prompts (redirect to concrete goals). Visible overrides (transparency when crossing pre-committed boundaries). The AI becomes a governor instead of fuel.",
    "countermeasure": "The countermeasure isn't 'stop using AI.' It's 'design AI to anchor when you need it.'",
