  "why": {
    "title": "Why Narratives?",
    "paragraph1": "Traditional AI safety systems are designed with specifications, test suites and formal methods. This works for technical requirements. But ethical dilemmas don't exist in specifications.",
    "quote": "How do you know your AI safety system works when the human and AI have different information? When classification creates asymmetry? When time forces decisions before complete verification?",
    "paragraph2": "You test it by putting people in the scenario - not abstractly, but concretely. What do they see? What does the AI know? What must they decide? What do they feel?",
    "paragraph3": "This is not storytelling for marketing. This is narrative stress-testing as design method. We don't build AI systems and test them later. We write stories about impossible decisions first - and discover what the system must handle."

  "process": {
    "title": "The Process: From Narrative to Framework",
    "step1": {
      "title": "Identify The Impossible Decision",
      "description": "What is the situation where both approving the AI and stopping the AI feels wrong? Where is the information asymmetry? Where is the time pressure? Where are the ethical tensions?",
      "example_label": "Example",
      "example": "Morgan sees an elderly civilian. The AI says \"threat\" based on TOP SECRET information. What does Morgan decide when she can't verify what the AI sees?"
    },
    "step2": {
      "title": "Write The Narrative From Human Perspective",
      "description": "Not abstract \"Guardian Witness observes.\" But: What does Morgan see on screen? What does she feel in her body? What buttons exist? What does Command say? Concrete. Sensory. Emotional.",
      "example_label": "Why",
      "example": "Abstractions hide design problems. \"System provides transparency\" says nothing. \"Morgan sees 'CLASSIFICATION NOTICE' but not WHAT is classified\" shows exactly what the system must communicate."
    },
    "step3": {
      "title": "Extract System Requirements From Narrative",
      "description": "Every time Morgan needs something in the story - it's a system requirement. Every doubt she feels - it's a design gap. Every decision she must make - it's an interface design question.",
      "example_label": "Discovery",
      "example": "Morgan needs her own Verification AI (not just HiveMind) to double-check logical consistency. This became the MRAF component in Guardian Protocol."
    },
    "step4": {
      "title": "Implement The Framework",
      "description": "Now - and only now - do we write technical specifications. But they are grounded in what Morgan needed in the scenario, not in abstract \"best practices.\"",
      "example_label": "Result",
      "example": "Guardian Protocol (NIPS, MRAF, Classification-Aware Explanation, Trust-But-Verify, Guardian Witness role) - all extracted from Morgan's narrative."
    },
    "step5": {
      "title": "Stress-Test With New Narratives",
      "description": "Write more impossible stories. Morgan makes the right decision - but what happens when Guardian Witness has bias? When Command is also wrong? When the AI learns to exploit protocols? Every new story finds new gaps.",
      "example_label": "Iteration",
      "example": "This is iterative design. Narrative → Framework → New narratives → Updated framework. We publish both - the stories AND the frameworks - so experts can find the flaws we missed."
