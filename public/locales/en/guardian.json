    "title": "Executive Summary",
    "description": "Guardian Protocol is a framework for traceability and accountability in AI-based critical systems. When AI makes decisions affecting life or safety - who's responsible? Guardian Protocol ensures every decision traces to named individuals: the developer who coded the rule, the operator who made the call, the commander who authorized the mission. Meets EU AI Act requirements for high-risk AI.",
    "tagline": "No fog of war. No 'the system did it.' Just clear accountability."

  "problem": {
    "title": "The Challenge: Ukraine, January 2026",
    "scenario": "Ukrainian positions faced 500+ hostile drones per day. Autonomous shotgun turrets worked perfectly - 127 drone kills, zero incidents.",
    "adaptation": "Then Russia adapted: ground assault instead of drones.",
    "dilemma": "The turrets CAN engage ground targets. But they were certified for drones only.",
    "question": "Do you authorize mission expansion? Who decides? Who's accountable when autonomous systems are used beyond their designed purpose?"
  },
  "solution": {
    "title": "The Solution: Graduated Authorization + Individual Accountability",
    "approach": "Guardian Protocol provides a framework where every lethal decision traces through a complete accountability chain - from the developer who wrote the code to the commander who authorized the mission.",
