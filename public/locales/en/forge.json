    "description": "Forge Protocol is a framework for building AI systems across security boundaries. It tracks every code change, every review, every approval - creating a complete provenance chain from requirements to deployment. When integrated with Guardian Protocol, it enables complete accountability: from the developer who wrote the code to the operator who made the lethal decision.",
