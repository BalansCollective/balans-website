    "description": "Forge Protocol is a framework for building AI systems across security boundaries, developed to solve five critical problems preventing secure AI development in defense:",
    "benefits": [
      "Developers with different clearances can collaborate - without leaking secrets",
      "Code can be built and tested - even when specifications are classified",
      "Compliance is provable - automatic validation against standards",
      "Audit is complete - full provenance from requirements to deployment",
      "Innovation accelerated - no 6-month SÄPO wait for each startup"

      {
        "title": "Problem 4: Provenance Loss",
        "description": "Security incident → Investigation needs to know 'Who changed this parameter? Why? Was it approved?' → Git log lacks context → Inconclusive investigation."
