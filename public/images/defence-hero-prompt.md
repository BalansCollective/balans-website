## DALL-E Prompt (Final Version)

```
Create a photorealistic Swedish secure office desk setup with classified AI coding workflow:

ENVIRONMENT:
- Modern Scandinavian office (light wood desk, white/gray walls)
- NO WINDOWS (secure facility)
- Recessed LED ceiling lights
- Minimal decor: small plant, coffee mug, notebook

COMPUTERS (LEFT TO RIGHT):

1. MacBook Pro 16" (left) - Label: "INTERNET CONNECTED"
   - Screen: Cursor IDE + ChatGPT
   - USB-C cable to diode

2. ZENOH USB DATA DIODE (center) - HERO ELEMENT
   - Circular transparent base (10cm)
   - Two Teensy 4.1 boards (left & right, 9-3 o'clock)
   - Orange 1N4148 diode in center (black band pointing RIGHT)
   - NeoPixel LED ring (24 LEDs, warm white glow, diffused)
   - ALL wiring visible on top:
     * TX: left Teensy → diode → right Teensy RX
     * NeoPixel wires ONLY to LEFT Teensy (security: no reverse channel)
   - Two USB-C cables (MacBook → left Teensy, right Teensy → PC)
   - Label: "ZENOH DATA DIODE - HARDWARE-ENFORCED ONE-WAY"

3. PC tower (right, ON desk) + Widescreen monitor - Label: "AIR-GAPPED (NO INTERNET)"
   - Modern PC case with visible RTX GPU inside
   - 32-34" ultrawide monitor positioned BEHIND the tower
   - Monitor connected to PC tower via DisplayPort cable (visible)
   - Monitor shows: AI code suggestions and analysis interface
   - USB-C cable from diode entering tower front/top panel
   - Monitor and tower together form the "air-gapped workstation"

PERIPHERALS:
- Wireless keyboard (Keychron, white keys, Swedish layout)
- Wireless mouse (Logitech MX Master 3)
- Shared between both computers (KVM under desk)

CABLES (visible but neat):
- USB-C: MacBook → diode left Teensy
- USB-C: diode right Teensy → PC tower
- DisplayPort: PC tower → widescreen monitor
- Monitor power cable to floor

LIGHTING:
- Cool white ceiling lights
- Warm desk lamp (right side)
- Diode NeoPixel ring glowing subtly (brighter on right = data flow)

LABELS:
- Large readable signs: "INTERNET CONNECTED" / "AIR-GAPPED (NO INTERNET)"
- Professional office signage style

KEY DETAILS:
- Diode detailed enough to see: 2 Teensys, center diode, LED ring
- NeoPixel wires visibly ONLY to left Teensy (tamper-evident security)
- Open-frame design - all components inspectable
- Diode is focal point with subtle glow
- Widescreen clearly connected to PC tower (not MacBook)

STYLE:
- Photorealistic architectural photography
- Swedish premium aesthetic (lagom)
- Professional secure facility atmosphere
- Convey: "Defense contractors coding with AI in classified environments"
```
