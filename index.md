## Safe AI Tools for Families

---

### What We Do

We build simple AI tools that help families support each other. Our tools work alongside medical treatment and are designed with Swedish lagom principles - balanced, practical, and safe.

We create technology that serves families, not the other way around.

---

### Our Approach

**Family-First Design**  
AI helps you support your loved ones better. You stay in control of important decisions.

**Simple and Clear**  
Everything is written in plain language that busy parents can understand.

**Start Small**  
We begin with basic tools, prove they help, and only add more when you're ready.

**Safe and Transparent**  
You always know what the AI is doing and why.

---

### What We're Building

We're developing tools that help families know what to do during difficult times - step-by-step guides that work with existing medical care.

### Our Story

Balans Collective started when our founder discovered that AI could create helpful guides for families during difficult times. His parents went from feeling helpless to knowing exactly how to help.

We realized this could help many other families who want to support loved ones with mental health challenges, but don't always know what to do.

We're building simple, safe tools that give families practical guidance they can use right away.

### Swedish Values

**Lagom Development**  
We build carefully, test thoroughly, and grow responsibly.

**Family-Centered**  
Every family's needs matter in how we design our tools.

**Practical Focus**  
We create tools that work in real situations for real families.

**Clear Communication**  
Honest, simple language builds trust and better solutions.

### For Families

If you have a family member who struggles with mental health or other challenges, our tools might help you feel more confident about how to support them.

We're still building and testing, but we're committed to creating simple, practical help for real families.
