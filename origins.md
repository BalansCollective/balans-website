# Origins

## How We Started

---

### The Problem

Our founder has bipolar disorder and gets medication from Swedish doctors. The medicine helps, but his parents didn't know what to do during difficult episodes at home.

---

### What Happened

Our founder had been exploring what current AI systems could do. During one difficult episode, this work proved unexpectedly useful - the AI created helpful guides for his parents with step-by-step instructions.

The AI helped his parents know exactly what to do instead of feeling helpless.

---

### What We're Building

We're building safe AI tools that help families support each other. The tools work alongside medical treatment, with proper safeguards.

We write everything in plain language that busy parents can understand and use right away.

---

### For Families

If you have a family member who struggles with mental health or other challenges, our tools might help you feel more confident about how to support them.

We're still building and testing, but we're committed to creating simple, practical help for real families.
